This repository contains a collection of notebooks that showcase genomics data analysis, both traditional statistical approaches and machine learning appraoches. 

## SARS-COV-2 Protein Sequence Alignment 
**Task:** Aligns sequences of the spike protein of various SARS-COV-2 samples and identify the variant (Omicron vs delta etc.) based on the mutations found.

**Data:** fasta file of spike protein sequences fetched from NCBI spike_protein_seqs.fasta

Programs used:
biopython

## Gene mutation & Cancer
**Task:** Determine which mutations have high risk for developing neuroblastoma
	Predict whether patient will progress to high risk based on their gene expressions data

**Data** Mutations data, RNA expressions data, Clinical data
